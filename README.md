Description:
GetFitVR is a VR application that provides an environment to learn and perform exercises. This project is designed for the android platform only, using GoogleVR Cardboard as its target development. The application has three exercises: Situp, Twist Crunch, Twist Lunge. All control is done via head movement and gaze pointer mechanics. Documentation within the project contains clearer details on member contribution and how to run the application. In the repo is also an apk called "final.apk", which is the completed final prototype for the application.

All four members contributed to this project. For clearer details on which parts, please email nolankuo17@gmail.com for any questions.
